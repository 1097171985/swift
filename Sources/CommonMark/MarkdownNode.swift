/// which help to enforce the containment relationship between the types of nodes in the AST.

  /// The range that the node occupies in the original source text, if known.

  /// The value of this property is provided by the parser when it parses Markdown source text. It

  /// This CommonMark module supports user extensions to the model, such that the parser can be

  /// `InlineContent`. When those custom nodes are rendered back out to HTML, Markdown, or some
  /// other format, the library needs to be able to map those custom nodes back to a representation
  /// that is expressed in terms of the built-in node types.
